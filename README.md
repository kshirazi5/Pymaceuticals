# Pymaceuticals

 Recently, a pharmaceutical company began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. 

As a data analyst at the company, we've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
The executive team has tasked us with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked us for a top-level summary of the study results.

Analysis

-The tumor in mouse l509 decreased in size over time. This mouse was treated with capomulin. -Capomulin and Ramicane had the most significant decreases in tumor size. Mice treated with Infubinol and Ceftamin had larger increases in tumor size. -There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor size. The regression analysis establishes that there is a direct relationship between these two variables. The P-Value is .84 with an r-squared of .70.
